Files for the 'segment-anything' repository explicitly states 'The model is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.' Notice, this explicitly places the model, not merely the software, under that license.

Although any SAM model should still inherit the 'Apache 2.0 license' of the upstream 'segment-anything' model and source code, that may not have precluded the 'CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic)' 'for academic research use only' 'Ho_Minh_Duy.Nguyen@dfki.de' license associated with the 'LVM-Med' source code .

'We use and modify codes from SAM and MedSAM for prompt-based segmentation settings. A part of LVM-Med algorithm adopt data transformations from Vicregl, Deepcluster-v2. We also utilize vissl framework to train 2D self-supervised methods in our collected data. Thank the authors for their great work!
